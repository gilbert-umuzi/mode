# Mode / SQL Yammer Case Study

## Introduction
This repository contains my analysis and learnings from the [Mode / SQL Yammer case study](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/a-drop-in-user-engagement). The project focuses on investigating user engagement on Yammer, a messaging platform, using Mode and a combination of SQL queries and Python analysis. The tutorial provided an opportunity to test Mode, applying SQL, Python, and data visualization skills.

## Key Learnings
### Integration of SQL and Python in Mode
* SQL Query Organization and Graphical Analysis: Mode's effective organization of SQL queries and its graphical analysis capabilities are well-suited for embedding insights directly into reports.
* Python Integration: The use of Python notebooks in conjunction with SQL queries proves valuable, particularly for statistical analysis, offering a significant timesaver compared to complex SQL queries.
* Workflow Consideration: A notable challenge is the need to restart and rerun Python notebooks with each modification in SQL queries, affecting the fluidity of analysis.
### Enhancements in SQL Skills
* Session-Based User Engagement: Learning to aggregate user engagement data into sessions was a major takeaway, providing a new perspective and depth in data analysis.
* Complex Queries: The complexity of nested SQL queries was balanced with the insights they enabled, showcasing the power of SQL in dissecting and understanding data.
* Incremental Query Building: Developing complex SQL queries incrementally, from simpler inner queries to more intricate outer layers, proved beneficial for both understanding and future reusability.

## Repository Structure
* report: final report detailing the findings and insights from the tutorial - Yammer-case-study.pdf
* sql_queries: three sample queries are presented: engagement, search, and ab_test.
* python_notebook: focusing on the ab test - python3-notebook_yammer-case-study.py
* data: sample data files used in the project are available as part of the [Mode case study](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/a-drop-in-user-engagement).


## Dependencies
* Mode Analytics
* SQL (compatible with Mode Analytics environment)
